#Football quiz game
___
#Main information
___
This a simple game project to test my basic knowledge of JS, HTML & CSS.
The game is basically "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" but with questions from the football world cup history, minus the money ladder, asking the audience etc.
The game is hosted on Netlify and the live preview is [here](https://football-quizz.netlify.app/).
#More technical info & and future of the project
___
So right now the games DB (the questions and answers) is an array of objects in a separated file, in the future i will move the DB to MongoDB. Also i plan to use React and some CSS framework for the frontside of the page.
